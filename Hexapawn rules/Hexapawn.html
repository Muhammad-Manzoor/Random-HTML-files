        <h1>How to play</h1>
        <p class="pre">
            Hexapawn is based on chess.<br>
            Each player has 3 pawns on a board with 9 squares(3x3 arrangement).<br>
            The pieces move like chess pawns too.<br>
            They can go forward one space if that space is unoccupied, if it is occupied by the opponent then they can't go forward.<br>
            You can however move diagonally, but only to take an opponent's piece.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>There are three ways to win:</h2>
        <p class="pre">
            1. Get a pawn to the other side of the board.<br>
            2. Take all of your opponent's pieces.<br>
            3. Leave your opponent without a possible move.<br>
